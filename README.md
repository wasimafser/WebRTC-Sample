Implementation of a video conferencing system using WebRTC.

This project was brought up for educational purposes, to know the working of async connections, WebRTC, websockets etc.
There is no plan in futher development of this project until someone else is also ready to help me out with stuff and also probably head this going forward.

## Stack

### Backend
Django - channels / rest_framework

### Frontend
Html / CSS / JS

## Working
Bring up the project as you would run a Django server.

Go to `<host>:<port>/client_1/` in one tab / window and `<host>:<port>/client_2/` in another to start and join a room.
Once in, enjoy video calling yourself.

## TODO
* Check if recording is working or not, if not fix it
* Fix the UI
* Cleanup and optimize the system.
